                        <p>That's me and maddie, she's my college bestfriend! We may not always talk over the internet but we always have a hundred of topics in personal. We're always prepared to not sleep just to chitchat in the middle of the night. We live in the same roof during the weekdays that's why we have a lot of time together. We also love watching movies even if we have a lot of workloads to do. We also love taking pictures, but we have no posing skills.</p>

                        <p>"It's Mark Joseph. Even now, I find myself still undecided on how best to describe him. He's not just someone I adore and cherish, but someone I can always rely on. He's my boyfriend, yes, but he seamlessly transitions between roles: a boyfriend, a best friend, a consultant, a fan... he effortlessly adapts to whatever I need. We share so much in common, yet our differences enrich our connection. Despite any challenges, we always manage to find resolution by the end of the day."</p>
